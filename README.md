The main objective of this project was to predict future ground height changes in the Hondsbossche Dunes by analyzing satellite-based InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. Using advanced time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX, we aimed to monitor and forecast dune surface movements over time, integrating weather data to improve prediction accuracy and support sustainable coastal management in the Netherlands.
